Music notation for a 1930 mandolin-banjo blues recording by Charlie McCoy. I figured out the notes, wrote them down as notation, and wrote a Makefile to manage the process. Source code for the notation is Lilypond.

Versions for Bb and F transposing instruments are included. See the "build" directory.
