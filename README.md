Music notation for a 1930 mandolin-banjo blues recording by Charlie McCoy. I figured out the notes, wrote them down as notation, and wrote a Makefile to manage the process. Source code for the notation is Lilypond.

I only wrote out the chords for the first round, because this enabled me to squeeze it all onto a single page. I only transcribed the mandolin-banjo part and not the guitar part, even though I'd like to learn the guitar part also, eventually. Some of this transcription was tough sledding and I'm sure there are errors here - enabling you to not have to live with my bugs, adding chords, etc, is what sharing the source code is all about. Comments and corrections are welcome.

Versions for Bb and F transposing instruments are included. See the "build" directory.
